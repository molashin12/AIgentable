# AIgentable - Multi-Tenant AI Agent Platform

## 1. Product Overview

AIgentable is a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS platform that enables businesses to create, deploy, and manage custom AI agents for various business roles including sales, customer service, and support across multiple communication channels.

The platform leverages LangChain framework for advanced AI orchestration, with enhanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology using ChromaDB for vectorization. LangChain provides standardized AI provider management, sophisticated chain-based message processing, and future-ready agent workflows. The solution offers omnichannel integration with WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, and website widgets, making it a complete AI-powered customer engagement solution.

Target market: Small to medium businesses seeking to automate customer interactions and scale their customer service operations efficiently. The platform is designed for acquisition-ready scalability with modern tech stack, clean architecture, and enterprise-grade AI orchestration capabilities.

## 2. Technical Architecture & LangChain Integration
